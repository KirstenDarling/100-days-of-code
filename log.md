# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 12, 2020 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my Skillcrush class projects focusing on Flexbox layout and Responsive Design.

**Thoughts:**: I love Flexbox! The first time I learned about Flexbox and CSS Grid it was a little confusing. Finally, on this project it clicked. And now, Flexbox seems simple.
