# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 12, 2021 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my Skillcrush class projects focusing on Flexbox layout and Responsive Design.

**Thoughts:**: I love Flexbox! The first time I learned about Flexbox and CSS Grid it was a little confusing. Finally, on this project it clicked. And now, Flexbox seems simple.

### Day 3: January 14, 2021 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Im getting back into the Github habit! I added several projects on Github Pages like this static vision board.

**Thoughts**: Git is easy peasy. I need to use it everyday until it's second nature.

### Day 4: January 16, 2021 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my vision board from the day before. I made the colors prettier and bolder, I changed the background image and some of the text, and most importantly--- I made it responsive. So, now it looks good on mobile devices too!

**Thoughts**: The darker colors look so much better. I need to convert all my old static sites to responsive ASAP. I love Flexbox.
